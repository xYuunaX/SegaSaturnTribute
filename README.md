# Experimental Settings for Saturn Tribute Emulator

      Note: Testing has been only been done in Portable Mode, so your results may vary.
      
If a config does not exist, you may try out one of the generic ini, it may not need specific settings and could help or improve performance. (3D/2D) 

Tips on tweaking your own config.

      * AlternativeDecode="0" if sound is stutering
      * BlockCode="100-450" if the game doesn't boot, try BlockCode 200 and work your way up/down.
      * VDP1DrawThread="1" may boost performance for certain titles, but will cause stuttering for others
      * CDBlockNoWait="1" for faster loading, may cause some games to load into blackscreen.
      * Deinterlace="1" (Not sure if this has any effect, but apparently it's suppose to speed up some games)

### Common Settings:
* Cartridge set to 1MB (Change to 4MB (5c) if needed)
* Widescreen/Stretch Off 
* Bilinear Filtering Off
* Vsync Off (VSynchWait)
* Frame Skip Off (AutoFieldSkip)
* Background Off
* Anti Aliasing Off
* Full Screen
* Sound Vol adjusted to 100%
